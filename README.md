# EnhancedDiscordPlugins
A small set of plugins for EnhancedDiscord. Support for these will be minimal but can be found on [my server](http://discord.zackrauen.com/) or the ED server.

## Plugin List
 - [ReadAll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/EnhancedDiscordPlugins/master/ReadAll.js) - Adds a button to mark all guilds as read.
 - [ClassNormalizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/EnhancedDiscordPlugins/master/ClassNormalizer.js) - Normalizes classes like channels-Ie2l6A by adding a version like da-channels.
