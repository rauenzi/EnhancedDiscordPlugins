# EnhancedDiscordPlugins
A small set of plugins for EnhancedDiscord. Support for these will be minimal but can be found on [my server](http://discord.zackrauen.com/) or the ED server.

## Important
Since I made it possible to use BD plugins as normal plugins in ED itself, I am discontinuing the converted plugins since they are way less stable than the modified ED. You can install the modified version of ED using [this installer.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/415250660443815936/512334874774994944/EnhancedDiscordUI.exe) I will remove this notice when the [PR](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord/pull/47) has been merged.

This repo will now be dedicated to the plugins that I made for ED specifically.

## Plugin List
 - [ReadAll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/EnhancedDiscordPlugins/master/ReadAll.js) - Adds a button to mark all guilds as read (does not require lib).
